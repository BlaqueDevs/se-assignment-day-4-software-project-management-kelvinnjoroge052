ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS.
1. Importance of Timely Delivery & Ensuring Deadlines Are Met Why it’s crucial: Delays can lead to increased costs, missed market opportunities, loss of client trust, and failure to meet business goals. How to ensure deadlines are met: Clear Scope Definition – Avoid scope creep by defining project boundaries. Effective Planning – Use project scheduling techniques like Gantt charts and PERT diagrams. Agile Methodologies – Continuous iterations help track progress. Risk Management – Identify and mitigate risks early. Resource Allocation – Assign the right people to the right tasks. Regular Monitoring – Use tools like Jira, Trello, or MS Project to track progress. Stakeholder Communication – Keep clients and teams updated.
 2. Effective Cost Control & Preventing Budget Overruns Importance: Budget overruns can lead to financial losses, reduced profitability, and even project failure. Strategies: Accurate Estimation – Use cost estimation models (e.g., COCOMO). Budget Buffering – Allocate contingency funds. Regular Cost Monitoring – Track expenses against planned costs. Prioritization – Focus on essential features first (MVP approach). Vendor & Resource Management – Optimize outsourcing and procurement costs.
4. Agile vs. Waterfall Methodologies
5. When to Use Agile vs. Waterfall 
Agile is best for:
Rapidly changing requirements (e.g., startup MVPs). Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platforms (e.g., Spotify). UX/UI-driven applications needing constant updates (e.g., mobile apps). 
Waterfall is best for:
Fixed-scope projects like banking software (e.g., core banking systems). Compliance-heavy industries (e.g., healthcare). Large enterprise software with structured approval processes. 

6. Quality Assurance (QA) Methods & Importance Methods: Code Reviews – Peer reviews catch early mistakes. Automated Testing – Tools like Selenium, JUnit, and Cypress. Continuous Integration (CI/CD) – Regular builds and deployments. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) – Ensures product meets customer needs. Why QA is crucial: Prevents software failures, enhances user experience, and reduces maintenance costs. 

7. Project Scope & Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Project Scope: Defines what is included/excluded in the project, avoiding "scope creep." WBS (Work Breakdown Structure): A hierarchical decomposition of tasks. Helps in estimating time, cost, and resource allocation. Example: - Software Development - Requirements Gathering - Design Phase - Development - Testing - Deployment

8. Project Scheduling & Gantt Charts Benefits: Helps in tracking progress. Improves resource management. Prevents bottlenecks. Gantt Charts: Visual timeline of project tasks. Shows dependencies between tasks. Example: Trello, MS Project, Asana. 

9. Core Issues Addressed by the Software Identifies pain points in the industry. Ensures problem-solution alignment. Example: A fintech app may address slow transaction processing or high remittance fees.

10. Importance of Problem Definition Ensures development is focused. Helps in prioritizing features. Attracts investors by clearly defining market needs. 

11. Non-Technical Software Description Example: Instead of saying “AI-powered risk assessment tool,” say: “A platform that helps businesses assess financial risks in seconds.”

12. Key Features that Differentiate the Software Unique value proposition (e.g., faster processing, AI automation, intuitive UI). Integration capabilities with other software. Scalability and security features.

13. Market Size & Growth Potential Use industry reports from sources like Gartner, Statista, IBISWorld. Analyze: Total Addressable Market (TAM) Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

14. Using Market Trends for Software Positioning Tracks customer needs and competitive landscape. Helps in pricing strategy. Guides feature development based on trends (e.g., AI automation, blockchain, cybersecurity).
